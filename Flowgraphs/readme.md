# Flowgraphs Folder

## batmanNoGui.py

This flowgraph can be used to create a working network interface on your computer. As the name suggests, it is compatible with batman-adv and does not have a GUI interface. 

## batNoGui.grc

Same as the above but is the GRC Flowgraph for the resulting python file.

## broadcastwithFreqNoMac.py

A long name, but essentially the same as the above but with a GUI. The name may change before the readme does. 

## broadcastwithFreqNoMac.grc

Same as above but as a flowgraph.
